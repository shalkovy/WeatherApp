**Stack: iOS 14.0 (more than 96% users uses iOS 14 or later according to Apple), Swift, UIKit**

**What to improve**:

- I did the task without usage of third-party libraries, but for improvents I will add SnapKit to make UI layout methods more redable, also for the same puprose I can add Quick/Nible to simplify tests and Moya for networking
- Implement DI
- Add more tests
- Add SwiftLint
- Make more user friendly UI, of course :) 

**Advantages of VIPER**:
  
- **Scalability**: Enables seamless collaboration among team members working simultaneously on different modules.
  
- **Reusability**: Promotes the creation of decoupled app components based on their specific roles, making them reusable in various parts of the application.
  
- **Consistency**: Enforces a clear separation of concerns, ensuring that each module has a single responsibility and adheres to SOLID principles.
  
- **Clarity**: Enhances codebase clarity by breaking down the application into smaller, well-defined components, each with a single responsibility.
  
- **Testability**: Separates small classes, making it conducive to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and achieving better code coverage.
  
- **Interfaces**: Encourages module independence and well-defined scopes through its structured architecture.
  
- **Bug Fixing**: Simplifies the process of tracking issues, locating bugs, and addressing problems, resulting in a more efficient debugging process.

**Drawbacks**:
While VIPER offers numerous advantages, it comes with some drawbacks, including increased verbosity due to many files per module, complexity arising from the use of protocols and delegates, and potential engagement challenges from those who don't have expirience with VIPER.

Despite its drawbacks, VIPER remains a powerful choice for developing complex projects, as it emphasizes maintainability, scalability, and code quality through SOLID principles and a well-structured architectural pattern.
